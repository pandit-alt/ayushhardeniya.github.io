                            <p>
                                Hi, I'm Ayush Hardeniya [Legally known as Ayush Sharma] - a student and digital creator from India who loves crafting meaningful web experiences. This page is a quick introduction to my background, my journey with technology, and the values I bring into every project I work on.
                            </p>
                            <p>I was born in July 2006, in a beautiful village on the Aligarh-Mathura Road, Uttar Pradesh. Growing up in a loving, educated family, I was especially close to my grandpa – my biggest inspiration and guide.</p><br>

                            <h2>🌾 Village Roots</h2>
                            <p>My childhood was spent running through our village with friends, playing endless games of cricket, and soaking in the simple joys of rural life. Those early years taught me the value of community and connection. When I first joined DMPS, it was my formal start to education – but the real learning had already begun.</p><br>

                            <h2>🌅 Early Morning Lessons</h2>
                            <p>One of my most cherished memories is walking with my grandpa to the river bridge, 2 kilometers away, at 4 AM every morning. These walks weren’t just exercise – they were life lessons, wrapped in quiet conversations and the beauty of dawn. That’s where I learned discipline, mindfulness, and a deep appreciation for nature and simplicity.</p><br>

                            <h2>📚 School Days and Discovery</h2>
                            <p>In 2015, everything changed when I joined CPS Public School with my siblings. This is where I truly discovered what education could mean – thanks to my grandpa’s constant guidance. The school became a playground for learning. Between grades 5 to 8, I worked on various individual and team projects, and it was during these years that I first felt the joy of building something meaningful.</p><br>

                            <h2>🏆 High School Success</h2>
                            <p>I later moved to GDPS for high school. Many late-night study sessions, and a lot of silent perseverance, finally paid off when I scored 96.4% in my board exams. But more than marks, it was the pride in my grandpa’s eyes that made it all worth it.</p><br>

                            <h2>🏙️ The Big City Move</h2>
                            <p>Grade 11 brought new challenges – and a move to Aligarh, a bigger city. Every day, my cousin and I would travel over 70 kilometers, turning that commute into our shared routine of learning, laughter, and resilience.</p><br>

                            <h2>💔 The Hardest Chapter</h2>
                            <p>December 2021 changed my life. I lost my grandpa – the person who had always been by my side. I was with him in his final moments at the hospital, giving him water and medicine – just like he had once cared for me. That night is carved into my heart. Losing him felt like losing my compass, but his teachings had already taken root in me.</p><br>

                            <h2>🌾 Finding Strength in Roots</h2>
                            <p>With my family's support, I continued my studies. During that time, I also felt drawn back to our farming roots. Working in the fields wasn’t just about helping out – it was something deeper. The smell of the soil, the rhythm of the work – it grounded me, reminded me where I come from.</p><br>

                            <h2>🚀 Looking Forward</h2>
                            <p>After completing Grade 12, I stepped into college life with curiosity and drive. To me, college isn’t just about earning a degree – it’s my launchpad. A space to experiment, build, and eventually take flight.</p><br>

                            <h2>💛 The Silent Strength - Maa & Papa</h2>
                            <p>There’s a part of my story that stays mostly between the lines - my Maa and Papa.<br>
                                From the very beginning, whether it was funding my little learning projects during Grades 5–8, encouraging my curiosity in arts and crafts, or simply standing by me during silent emotional battles - they’ve been my quietest and strongest support.<br>
                                When my grandpa was nurturing me to grow into a good human being, they were the ones who stood firm behind every rise and fall. They never demanded to be seen or acknowledged - and perhaps that’s what makes their presence so powerful.<br>
                                I can never express them in words - and I don’t even try to.<br>
                                Because some bonds are felt, not described.<br>
                                They are the silent warriors of my journey - always present, always mine.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <p class="ending-note">
                                My story is still being written. But it's built on village values, quiet discipline, deep love, and one man’s belief in me – my Grandpa – who taught me that with honesty and effort, the sky is not the limit, it’s just the beginning.
                            </p>
                            <br> <br><br>
